The Great Escape v0.90 (April 2020)
================
This is The Great Escape application. It is a port to RISC OS of a
ZX Spectrum game originally released in 1986. The game has been
reverse engineered for the purposes of education from its original
Z80 assembly form and then reimplemented as portable C code.

Compatibility
-------------
RISC OS 3.1 or later.

Instructions
------------
Launch the game and choose 'Instructions' from the icon bar menu.

Copyright
---------
The original game was developed by Denton Designs and published by
Ocean Software and. Since this is a reverse engineered game
thirty-odd years old it's not possible for someone doing this as a
hobby (for the purposes of preservation and education) to
determine the current legal owners of the game.

While I claim no copyright over the original parts of the game, I
do claim copyright over the parts unique to this reimplementation.
