The Great Escape - Installation
===============================

General
-------
The Great Escape requires CallASWI 0.03 and
SharedCLibrary 5.17 or newer to be available in
your !System.

If you don't have them installed you can obtain a
copy in 'System resources' here:
https://www.riscosopen.org/content/downloads/common

Sound
-----
The Great Escape can play its menu screen music
and make in-game sound effects if your RISC OS
computer has 16-bit audio support. If that's the
case then use Configure's System window to merge
in the supplied !System. It contains the
SharedSoundBuffer modules required by the game.
